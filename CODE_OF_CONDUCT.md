![Welcome](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/02962eb19c0069740d16e67b5ba7c613238c8b9a/30ed2/_images/34435689480_2e6f358510_k_d.jpg)

## Purpose

A primary goal of [GreenteaOS community](https://github.com/GreenteaOS) is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Expected behavior

You should follow corresponding licences. Be it GPL, MIT, Creative Commons or whatever. We do not require from you doing anything useful, if you're not being paid for it.

## Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

*   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise **clearly (intentionally) offensively/discriminatory jokes and language targeting specific people within our community**.
*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material (if group is not rated 18+ like our Telegram group).
*   Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
*   Personal insults of any kind, if the targeted person finds them inappropriate.
*   Inappropriate photography or recording.
*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or **clearly (intentionally) offensive jokes targeting specific people within our community**; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
*   [Reverse discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_discrimination).
*   [SJW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice_warrior) behavior is *not* welcomed and may result in exclusion from community.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible by joining [Telegram group](https://t.me/greenteaos).

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
